## theory

### remembering, i.e. not forgetting

remembering just happens. our brains do it naturally. and it happens instantly.

immediately after remembering, forgetting begins. forgetting also just happens,
but it doesn't happen instantly. there is a rate at which the act of forgetting
occurs.

however, we know not everything must be forgotten. this rings true as long as a
brain is healthy; the same may not be true for a brain that operates within
different parameters than an average brain. but, in average circumstances, we
know not everything must be forgotten.

we can remember some things for a very, very long time. perhaps even until we
die. so, we know the rate of forgetting is not constant for all things
remembered, and can even be counteracted.

we do it all the time. we study, we repeat, we relate ideas, and we form
memories.

so, how much, exactly, or even approximately, must we study to remember
something? how many times must we repeat? how often? does relating the
information with other information help? (it does.) how much?

the high level breakdown can be seen in these "forgetting curves":

the goal of this program is to remember as much correct and relevant
information as is possible, in a way that is highly structured and relatable,
so its relations can also be mapped, studied, and remembered.
